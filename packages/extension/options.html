      <p>Why do I need input my OpenAI API key?</p>
      <p>
        For a more reliable and uninterrupted experience, we recommend using
        your own API key instead of relying on the default one. This will give
        you more control over the API connection and prevent potential issues
        such as outages or network problems that may occur with the default API
        key. By using your own API key, you can ensure that the extension works
        smoothly and delivers the results you need.
